Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
This challenge is based on a past analysis on weather condition and latitude analysis. Specifically, plotting weather data and building a dashboard.
Individual pages for each plot will be created to contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. In addition, a landing page to provide a summary, and another page where a comparison of all of the plots can be visualised. Finally, a page where to display the data used to build them.
Website Requirements
The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

o A descriptive title and heading tag.
o The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
o A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A "Comparisons" page that: 
o Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
o A Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 
* The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A "Data" page that: 
o Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. 
* The table is a bootstrap table component. 
* The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 
* The website at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
